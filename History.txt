== History

[jeckyl-0.4.0 01-Oct-2014]

  General tidy up of gem (README, rspec tests etc) to bring things up to date.

  Fix #to_s to return a string and not output!

  Added compound names to klass action for 'jeckyl' command, used to generate class
  files

  Updated merge to merge a hash as well as a file (using Hash#merge!)

[jeckyl-0.3.1 9-Apr-2013]

  Added class method get_config_opt to pre-parse -c cfile from the command line so that
  the specified config file can then be used for the rest of the options

[jeckyl-0.3.0 29-Mar-2013]

  Beta test. Jeckyl can now process command switches for the same options using optparse.
  Helper methods moved to a separate module and a couple of new ones added (a_number, a_positive_number).
  A to_s method added to make it easier to display values.

[jeckyl-0.2.7 15-Nov-2012]

  Change base directory for configs to /etc/jerbil consistent with the main jerbil gem

[jeckyl-0.2.6 25-Oct-2012]

  Revert to /etc/jermine while working through changes to other gems

[jeckyl-0.2.5 25-Oct-2012]

  Clean up unwanted git files and update README links (e.g. rubydoc)

  Deprecate ConfigRoot constant in favour of Jeckyl.config_dir, which will pick up
